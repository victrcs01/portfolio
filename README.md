Reposit√≥rio criado para servir como meu portfolio pessoal

## Prompt Inicial
`
I'm a systems engineering student looking to create a personal portfolio website using React and TypeScript. The website will serve to showcase my projects, skills, and blog posts. I would like the front-end project to include the following pages:

1. **Home**: An overview of who I am, with a brief introduction and links to other sections.
2. **About**: Detailed information about my background, education, and skills.
3. **Blog**: A section to publish articles and share insights on topics related to systems engineering and technology.
4. **Notebook**: A space to document my github's study repositories on ongoing projects, experiments, and personal notes. 

**Additional Requirements**:
- Responsive design to ensure compatibility with mobile devices.
- Use of a modern CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for styling.
- Implementation of smooth navigation between pages.
- Integration with a headless CMS (e.g., Contentful or Sanity) for managing blog posts.
- Deployment setup instructions for platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
- Git version control with clear commit messages and project structure.

Please provide a structured plan or scaffold for this React + TypeScript front-end project, including recommended libraries, folder structure, and any other best practices to follow.
